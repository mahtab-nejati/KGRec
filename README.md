# Topic recommendation systems: KGRec and KGRec+

This repository contains the SED-KGraph dataset, 
a crowed-sourced Software Engineering and Development topics Knowledge Graph, 
and replication package for **KGRec** and **KGRec+**, 
two topic recommenders based on this knowledge graph.

The repository contains scripts that need to be run in the specified order due to data dependency.

## Datasets

`Sample_sedkgraph.csv` provides a sample of the constructed knowledge graph. The full SED-KGraph dataset will be shared uppon paper acceptance.

The projects' information dataset are adopted from the following study</a>.
